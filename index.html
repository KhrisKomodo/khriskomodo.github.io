      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Welcome to my site!</h3>
      <p>I plan to just showcase stuff about me here, and use the process of making it to learn 
      Web Development.<br /><br /></p>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speedcubing</strong></li>
        <p>I have been a speedcuber since my 4th year of high school. 
        I have been to competitions before and plan to go to many more! 
        I do a variety of events and plan to be an All-Rounder.</p>
        <li><strong>Music</strong></li>
        <p>I have always been musically inclined. 
        I started playing the guitar in my second year of high school, 
        and have since also picked up the bass guitar. In addition to those, 
        I can compose for many instruments as I have a general understanding of 
        Western Music Theory.</p>
        <li><strong>Video Games</strong></li>
        <p>I have always been a shut-in, prefering to stay inside on my computer 
        instead of going outside and being active. I play a variety of games, 
        but mostly just cycle between a few titles rather than genres.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Academics</h2>
      <p>I'm still a student, so this section is just to showcase my journey so far 
      as well as my Academic Aspirations. I hope to some day become a Penetration Tester.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>College</strong></li>
        <p>I'm currently a student at Northwest Vista College. I'm currently getting an Associate's 
        Degree in Business Administration, and on course to graduate in 2027.</p>
        <p>After I graduate, I plan to transfer to the University of Texas at San Antonio to get 
        a Bachelor's Degree in Cyber Security.</p>
        <li><strong>Certificates</strong></li>
        <p>I don't currently hold any certifications, but I plan to get a range of IT Certificates, 
        such as CompTIA's A+, Network+, and Security+ certificates, as well as my CEH Certificate 
        and CCNA certificate.</p>
        <li><strong>Current Credentials</strong></li>
        <p>I attended high school at Corozal's Community College in my hometown of 
        Corozal Town, Belize.</p>

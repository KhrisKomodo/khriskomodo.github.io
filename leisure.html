    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>This page is what I do in my free time! While it is titled "hobbies"</p>
    <div id="cube">
      <h2>Speedcubing</h2>
      <p>I first learnt to solve a Rubik's Cube in my Senior Year of high school. I used online 
      resources and a mix of my own intuition, and overtime I only got faster. Since then, I have 
      learnt to solve a variety of other twisty puzzles and even attended the first ever official 
      World Cube Association (WCA) competition in my home country of Belize.</p>
      <p>I currently practice and participate in a number of events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2x2</li>
        <li>3x3</li>
        <li>3x3 One-Handed (OH)</li>
        <li>4x4</li>
        <li>5x5</li>
        <li>6x6</li>
        <li>7x7</li>
        <li>Megaminx</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have previously competed in speedsolving the Pyraminx, but haven't practiced in months. 
      I plan to eventually learn and compete in the various Blindfolded (BLD) events hosted by the 
      WCA, which are 3BLD, 4BLD, 5BLD, and Multi-BLD.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="music">
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I have always been musically inclined. When I was 14, I finally got my first guitar and 
      began learning. Since then, I have picked up the bass guitar as well, and my knowledge of 
      music theory has allowed me to compose parts for instruments I don't have the physical 
      technique for yet. I have performed a handfull of times; once as a guitarist for my high 
      school's choir as a Senior, once spontaneously joining two performers at a dinner event I 
      was at, and several times at private family events.</p>
      <p>In addition to playing, I listen to and enjoy music from a variety of genres, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rock</li>
        <li>Metal</li>
        <li>Hip-Hop</li>
        <li>Soca</li>
        <li>Reggae</li>
        <li>K-pop</li>
        <li>J-pop</li>
        <li>J-rock</li>
        <li>And many more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regarding specific bands and artists, I find myself regularly listening to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Black Label Society</li>
        <li>Metallica</li>
        <li>Death</li>
        <li>Ado</li>
        <li>Fuuji Kaze</li>
        <li>Kes</li>
      </ul>
